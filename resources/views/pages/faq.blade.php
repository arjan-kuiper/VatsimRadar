                        <p>VATSIM updates are limiting our refresh speeds which means that the
                        map will be updated approximately every 1-2 minutes.</p>

                        to <a href="mailto:arjanforgames52@gmail.com?SUBJECT=Virtual Airline">VatsimRadar</a></p>

                        If you hover over the circles you will see information regarding that specific air traffic controller.</p>

                        <h5>What are all those '<i>Sorry! The aircraft type of this airline has no image yet!</i>' ?</h5>
                        <p>VatsimRadar is devoting serious effort to supply as much aircraft imagery as possible
                        but there are <strong>a lot</strong> of different airlines and <strong>a lot</strong> of different aircraft.
                        VatsimRadar is working together with <a href="https://www.aviationimagenetwork.com/">Aviation Image Network</a> to
                        hopefully provide all the required imagery in the near future. It could also occur that a pilot is using made up airline
                        codes, incorrect formatted codes, or flying an aircraft type that the airline does not have in real life.</p>

                    <h5>What do you mean by '<i>We couldn't retrieve any information about this flight.</i>' ?</h5>
                        <p>Every piece of data regarding aircraft and ATC is pulled from VATSIM's publicly available
                        data file. As a pilot you can connect to the VATSIM network without needing to fill in your flightplan beforehand.
                        You will get this message when too much information is missing, because there will be nothing worth showing.</p>
